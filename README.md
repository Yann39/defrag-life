# General

My first **PHP/MySQL** website, build in **early 2000's**.

Still up and running and **W3C strict** compliant !

The website allowed players of the **DeFRaG mod** from the **Quake 3 arena** game to upload their demos (performance
recording) on maps created by me and my brother, so that we can build rankings.

It was also a way to share resources like maps, textures, wallpapers, etc. we liked to create.

# Usage

Website is accessible at the following address : http://quake.mysootybox.com/

The purpose is just to keep a usable snapshot of the website as a souvenir and so it does not become anonymous :)

I moved it "as is" from my old web host so some hardcoded/host-related features are missing, also sorry for Kitsch language, I was young :)

# Features

The website provided the following features :

- News list page (paginated) + admin page to submit news
- Map list page + admin page to add maps
  - VQ3/CPM type choice
  - paginated + sortable
  - downloadable files
  - 360 panoramic views (uses PurePlayerPro library))
  - list of players performances per map + downloadable demos
- Search functionality (maps and demos)
- Authenticated section (login / password)
- User upload functionality (allow to upload demos)
- Player and Country ranking
- Forum (removed later)
- Downloadable content (maps, demos, wallpapers, sky models, textures, software)
